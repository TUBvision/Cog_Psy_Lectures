\title{KOGW-PM-KNP: Tutorial 1 - Runeson`s Planimeter}
\author{}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Using planimeter, measure the shape provided. Describe how you did it [1]. What are the qualities of such a measurement [1], compared to say: counting squares*.
 \item[]
 \begin{itemize}
  \color{blue}
  \item Trace the edge of the shape, read off the value.
  \item More efficient / Higher precision / No calculations necessary
 \end{itemize}

 \color{black}
 \item Now try to measure the length of a line with the planimeter. Compare this with using a ruler. Can you think of a way in which you could measure the length of a line using the planimeter, given that it only measures area [1]?
 \item[]
 \begin{itemize}
  \color{blue}
  \item Use the area of a known shape to calculate the length (e.g. circle $Area = /pi radius^2$).
 \end{itemize}
 
 \color{black}
 \item Consider what methods you employed to solve Task 2. How does this differ from Task 1 [1]? How does this compare to perception vs cognition [1]?
 \item[]
 \begin{itemize}
  \color{blue}
  \item You employed a method to solve it rather than just following a instruction.
  \item Perception as directly accessing complex data, cognition as calculating complex data.
 \end{itemize}
 
 \color{black}
 \item Discuss with your group possible way to differentiate between pseudo-perceptual judgements and true perceptual reports? Use the table below to help, adding any more you can think of [3]. What are the problems with using such distinctions[2]?

  Pitfalls [2]
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Spectrum from high to low, with unknown cutoffs between.
   \item We can`t directly access much of our internal functioning.
   \item Based only on participants verbal reports.
   \item Accurate cognitive compensation could appear to be perceptual
   \item Other good comments.
  \end{itemize}

 \end{enumerate}

 Maximum marks 10/10 \\
 * Counting the number of squares, of known area, within the perimeter of the shape.
