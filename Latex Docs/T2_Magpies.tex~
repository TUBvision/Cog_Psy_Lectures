\maketitle

Working in a pairs, read the paper by Prior, Schwarz and G{\"u}nt{\"u}rk{\"u}n (2008) and answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What was the research question the authors wanted to address? [1]
 \item What experimental hypothesis did they formulate in order to test their research questions? Try to express this hypothesis in ``IF ..., then ...'' form. [2]
 \item Identify the independent and dependent variables in the experiment. [5]
 \item What type of realizations/operationalizations did the authors use to observe the dependent variable? (4)
 \item What variables did the authors identify as potentially confounding factors and how did they control for them? [2]
 \item What other potential confounds could you think of that the authors did not control and that could potentially invalidate their research? [2]
 \item Label the design as within- or between group design. [2]
 \item Create an example design matrix, for one subject, that is, a matrix containing one row for each trial of the experiment, and one column each for the independent variable, the control variables and the trial number. [2]
 \end{enumerate}

Please email me your answers (marianne.maertens@tu-berlin.de), together with a text file containing your design matrix including column names. Don't forget to include the names of both partners. \\
